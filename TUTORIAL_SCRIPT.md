- The player wakes up in the cell of a prison transport ship in route to
  Ganymede. The cell is small, has basic furniture and a small window from which
  the player can see outside.

- (narrator) Suddenly a very loud noise (explosion-like) is heard and lights go
  out. The door unlocks and the player is free to leave his cell.

- The second room is relatively empty, there are other cells similar to the one
  where the player was detained. At least one of them hs a prisoner inside,
  which the player might be able to free if he retrieves the key from the
  warden's room.

- The third one is a corridor, there is the body of a guard and some basic
  equipment near it (a gun, basic armor).

- In the fourth room there is a security droid, which will attack the player on
  sight.

- WIP room with cover

- WIP room with slightly more powerful enemy which will require the player to
  use a skill.

- WIP room with a health station

- WIP warden room, containing a terminal from which the player will be able to
  unlock the door to proceed to the next area. The terminal must be hacked in
  order to be used. 
   * In this room there is also a locker containing a keycard which opens the
     cell in the second room. If the player goes back and opens those cells, the
     prisoner[s] inside of them will get out and possibly become allies.

- End 1: the player faces a very difficult boss fight, at the end of which,
  should he survive, will get a powerful item.

- End 2: the player heads for the escape pod and survives.

### Boss fight

The boss itself will charge towards the player and inflict heavy melee damage.
It is impossible to defeat unless the room's mechanics are exploited.

Once the player enters the boss room a message will warn them that the monster
(which will be called experiment-67 or something like that) has broken free, and
that the doors of the room have been sealed.

There are two areas on the east side of the boss room (near the door from which
the player can enter) that stun the boss for a bunch of turns and apply a heavy
debuff that makes it possible to harm the creature. These traps are triggered by
one lever each, located near to the traps. They have a pretty long cooldown, so
if the player wants to defeat the monster needs to dance between the two pads.

When the debuff is about to end, a message is displayed notifying the player
that the creature seems to be regaining consciousness. The creature will become
active again after a given number of turns so the player needs to move in time
to avoid being hit.

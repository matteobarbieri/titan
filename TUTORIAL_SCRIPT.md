- The player wakes up in the cell of a prison transport ship in route to
  Ganymede. The cell is small, has basic furniture and a small window from which
  the player can see outside.

- (narrator) Suddenly a very loud noise (explosion-like) is heard and lights go
  out. The door unlocks and the player is free to leave his cell.

- The second room is relatively empty, there are other cells similar to the one
  where the player was detained. At least one of them hs a prisoner inside,
  which the player might be able to free if he retrieves the key from the
  warden's room.

- The third one is a corridor, there is the body of a guard and some basic
  equipment near it (a gun, basic armor).

- In the fourth room there is a security droid, which will attack the player on
  sight.

- WIP room with cover

- WIP room with slightly more powerful enemy which will require the player to
  use a skill.

- WIP room with a health station

- WIP warden room, containing a terminal from which the player will be able to
  unlock the door to proceed to the next area. The terminal must be hacked in
  order to be used. 
   * In this room there is also a locker containing a keycard which opens the
     cell in the second room. If the player goes back and opens those cells, the
     prisoner[s] inside of them will get out and possibly become allies.

- End 1: the player faces a very difficult boss fight, at the end of which,
  should he survive, will get a powerful item.

- End 2: the player heads for the escape pod and survives.
